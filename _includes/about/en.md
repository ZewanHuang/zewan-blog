Hi, I am _@Zewan_ (Huang, Zehuan), from Guangdong, an undergraduate in College of Software, Beihang University. 

During my undergraduate period, in addition to my studies, I was also exposed to several projects, and applied for _Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Programs_ and intra-school technology competitions, such as _FengruCup_. In my junior year, I also slowly determined my interest in 3D vision. I have begun to accumulate knowledge about _Neural Rendering_.
